User interfaces for the Ministry
Evaluating the website through Command Line Interface:  
1. Use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository into your "Projects" folder, you can use the following command: cd ~/Projects.  

2. Use the git clone command to clone the GitHub repository ie. git clone https://github.com/joshuakyayi256/MinistryICTnNG  
3. Now that you're inside the repository directory, you can open the HTML file in your default browser. To do this, you can use the open command followed by the name of the HTML file. i.e. open landing.html.
4. Thank You and I hope that helps you.
